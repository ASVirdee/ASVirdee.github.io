                <p>Hi, my name's Ameet and I'm a 21 year old maths graduate from London. As you can probably tell by the name of this website, I love playing videogames. This website is basically my take of a game review page. However, the major difference is that I'm rating these games purely based on my opinions of them. As such, there are probably some reviews and ratings you'll disagree with, and maybe even some opinions of games that you might find borderline criminal. Either way, I hope you enjoy my website :)</p>
                <h3>When did you start playing videogames?</h3>
                <p>When I was around 7 years old, my dad brought home a Nintendo Wii from work which everyone had lost interest in. I played on the Wii occasionally for several years until I got bored of it. Some of my favourite Wii games were Skylanders, Mariokart, Wii Play and (of course) Wii sports. After I stopped playing on the Wii, I mainly played flash games on websites like nitrome or armour games, as well as some MMOs such as Club Penguin and Monkey Quest.</p>
                <h3>At what point would you say you got into videogames?</h3>
                <p>Even though I played some Nintendo Wii when I was younger, I would say that it wasn't until the age of 16 that I really got invested in videogames. As a reward for my GCSE results, my parents agreed to get me a PS4. I spent that whole summer playing games such as Rocket League and Brawlhalla with my friends. </p>
                <h3>What kind of games do you like playing?</h3>
                <p>If you've already had a look through this website you most likely think that I've got quite a random/questionable taste in games, and you'd be right. I tend to vary the genres of games that I play to keep it interesting; I've found that if I play the same kind of game over and over again, I get bored easily. That being said, I would say that my favourite genre would have to be puzzle games since they're usually more different compared to each other than (for example) open-world games.</p>
