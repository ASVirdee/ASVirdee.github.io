                        <p>My first experience of 2D-platforming was with Hollow Knight, so I was a bit hesitant to try this game as it just platforming and nothing else and so I felt that it might be a bit repetitive and boring after a while. Fortunately I carried on playing and found out just why so many people rave about this game. The game is split in several chapters, each of which introduce new mechanics or obstacles into the game. As you progress from one chapter to the next you are met with a gradual difficulty curve which is hard enough to feel like more of a challenge than the previous one, but not hard enough to be overwhelming. There is also a lot more content for each chapter than it appears at first glance for example: there are strawberries hidden throughout the chapter which serve as collectables, and a crystal heart which you have to solve a hidden puzzle to get. In addition to this, all of the chapters have a more challenging B-side (some of which may induce head-shaped dents in your table), as well as a C-side which might make you want to jump off the top of Mount Celeste. Jokes aside, Celeste's tight platforming and excellent soundtrack makes it must-play game for any gamers looking for a fun platforming challenge.</p>

                        <p>Cult of the Lamb is a truly bizarre combination of adorable characters along with a sinister and creepy plot. In this game you can go from dancing with your cute-looking followers, to sacrificing one of them in a disturbing ritual in a matter of seconds. As the name suggests, you are a lamb who leads a cult. Pretty normal, right? The gameplay essentially alternates between going on 'crusades' to gather resources and find more followers to indoctrinate into your cult, and using the resources you've gathered to craft new buildings to improve and develop your cult. Each 'crusade' is a roguelike dungeon run, fighting through hordes of enemies until you reach a boss-battle at the end. Although the combat is good and you have a range of attacks to use, the runs do end up feeling like more of an unvaried routine later in the game. Similarly to the combat, the cult progression becomes tedious after a while. Although the game starts off as unique and engaging, it does start to get a little bit repetitive the further you get into it.</p>

                        <p>Turn-based deck-builders aren't really my cup of tea, but since this game is published by Devolver Digital (who have published a lot of my favourite games), I thought I'd give it a try. This is probably one of the most engrossing games I've ever played. What starts off as a simple card game in a dark cabin unexpectedly develops into something greater. I don't really want to give away too much information about the game in case you haven't played it yet; there are so many twists and turns that I would hate to spoil. All I have to say is this: even if you're not the biggest fan of turn-based deck-builders, I'd still recommend giving this game a go as you might be surprised.</p>

                        <p>The Pedestrian creatively turns street signs into platformer puzzles. As a fan of unique puzzle games, I had to try this one out as soon as I saw the trailer. The game has quite a cool art style; the relatively plain and basic design of the puzzles in the street signs contrasts excellently with rest of the highly detailed environment. The vivid environment is also sometimes included as part of the puzzle, which is a nice touch. The only drawback of the simple design of the street signs is that it makes the puzzles feel quite samey.</p>

                        <p>Dave the Diver is a game based around, you guessed it, a guy named Dave who works as a diver. However unlike most normal divers, our friend Dave catches fish during the day and runs a sushi restaurant by night. As you earn money from selling exotic dishes at Bancho's Sushi, you're able to upgrade your equipment which will help you to uncover the mysteries of the Blue Hole. There is a lot more content in this game than you'd think. You can do anything from fighting massive underwater bosses with a sniper rifle, to creating your own seahorse-racing team to fund your gambling addiction.</p>

                        <p>Have you ever dreamt about being an annoying goose and irritating everyone around you? Well, here's your chance. Untitled Goose Game lets you roam around a peaceful town, causing chaos and infuriation wherever you go. You are given a series of tasks to do, all of which centre around annoying people. These tasks have a puzzle element to them: you'll quickly realise that it's a lot harder to do seemingly mundane tasks like putting a rake in the lake or entering a pub as a goose. The fitting background music changes based on whether you're sneaking around trying to steal something from behind someone's back, or being chased after they've realised what you've done. This hilarious goose simulation is unironically one of the greatest games I've ever played and I would highly recommend it to anyone.</p>

                        <p>Arcadegeddon gets you into the action quite quickly and you might think that this fast-paced arcade shooter has some potential. But this potential slowly fades away as you realise that every level feels very similar: going around picking loot off the floor so you can level up for the next fight. The story seemed like it could've been good as well: you play the play the role of a gamer trying to save a local arcade from being taken over by a greedy corporation. The dialogue of most of the characters is quite cringey; it sounds like a 50-year-old trying way too hard to sound like a teenager. If that wasn't bad enough, the background music was also pretty terrible.</p>

                        <p>I never got the appeal of this game. I've played some telltale games before and thought they were decent, but this game just seems boring. The core concept of a highschooler being able to rewind time and change their decisions seems like it could lead to a lot of different options. However, the gameplay is surprisingly dull for a game involving time-control. The writing of the story itself feels quite lazy as the characters are quite cliche. This was quite a forgettable game to be honest.</p>

                        <p> Concrete Genie is a unique game where you solve puzzles by painting genies into the environment. While painting the walls of narrow streets and running away from bullies, you slowly unravel the history of Denska. Unlike other games with a similar theme of a child running away from bullies, the bullies in Concrete Genie have their own backstory beyond the typical "neglected child" . The game itself was rather short which was a shame. Also, there was a combat element which felt quite out of place for a game centred around painting.</p>

                        <p>This was a pretty strange game. You play as Georgio, a limo driver who doesn't speak. This seems like it would be a pretty normal game if it wasn't for one small detail: your limo is constantly rotating about its centre! Oh also, if you crash too often you explode. But this game gets even weirder still once Georgio starts taking pills and hallucinating about a talking skeleton. Honestly, this game just felt like a really bizarre dream you had as a kid. The levels were also pretty easy as it's nearly impossible to fail a mission: if you die, you just respawn close to where you died. However, this is one of those games where it was at least slightly funny because of how bad and weird the game was.</p>
